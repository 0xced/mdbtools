NAME
  mdb-parsecsv - Convert CSV table dump into C file.

SYNOPSIS
  mdb-parsecsv <file>

DESCRIPTION
  mdb-parsecsv is a utility program distributed with MDB Tools.

  mdb-parsecsv takes a CSV file representing a database table, and converts
  it into a C array.

NOTES
  If the first argument does not exist as a file, mdb-parsecsv will look for
  the same filename with '.txt' appended.

  The file extension is stripped, and the output written to the base name
  plus a '.c' extension.

AUTHORS
  The mdb-parsecsv utility was written by Brian Bruns
