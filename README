This is mdbtools version 0.002

This software is very, very pre-pre-pre-alpha (did I make my point?), so
unless you know C and probably a little something about databases and reverse
engineering file formats, you're welcome to try it out but don't expect much if anything to work.

For the rest of you, read the HACKERS file for a description of where the code 
stands and what has been gleened of the file format.

The initial goal of these tools is to be able to extract data structures and 
data from mdb files.  This goal may of course expand over time as the file 
format becomes more well understood (if it ever does).

To install type 'make' in the src directory and hope it works :-)

This will build three executables:

mdb-dump  -- a simple hex dump utility that I've been using to look at mdb files
prcat     -- print the catalog table from an mdb file,
prkkd     -- prints some info about design view data given the offset to it.
prtable   -- prints some info about a table definition.
prdata    -- prints a dump of the data given a table name.
