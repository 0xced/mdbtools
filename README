This is mdbtools version 0.01

This software is very pre-alpha, so don't expect to much unless you know C and 
probably a little something about databases and reverse engineering file 
formats, you're welcome to try it out but don't expect much if anything to work.

For the rest of you, read the HACKERS file for a description of where the code 
stands and what has been gleened of the file format.

The initial goal of these tools is to be able to extract data structures and 
data from mdb files.  This goal will of course expand over time as the file 
format becomes more well understood.  Also in the plans is a Gtk+ browser for 
MDB files and a ODBC/SQL frontend.

To install type 'make' in the src directory and hope it works :-)

This will build some useful utilities:

mdb-dump   -- simple hex dump utility that I've been using to look at mdb files
mdb-schema -- prints DDL for the specified table
mdb-export -- export table to CSV format

And some utilities useful for debugging:

prcat      -- prints the catalog table from an mdb file,
prkkd      -- dump of information about design view data given the offset to it.
prtable    -- dump of a table definition.
prdata     -- dump of the data given a table name.
