This is mdbtools version 0.001

This software is very, very pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha (did I make my point?), so
unless you know C and probably a little something about databases and reverse
engineering file formats, you're welcome to try it out but don't expect much if anything to work.

For the rest of you, read the HACKERS file for a description of where the code 
stands and what has been gleened of the file format.

The initial goal of these tools is to be able to extract data structures and 
data from mdb files.  This goal may of course expand over time as the file 
format becomes more well understood (if it ever does).

To install type 'make' and hope it works :-)

This will build three executables:

mdb-dump  -- a simple hex dump utility that I've been using to look at mdb files
prcat     -- print the catalog table from an mdb file (try offset 9000).
prkkd     -- prints some info about a KKD record given the offset to it.

If you're interested in digging into the project let me know, and I'll try to get a mailing list together.
